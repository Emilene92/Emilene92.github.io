    <h2>What is ia responsive site, and why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
      When using websites on different devices, like smart phones, tablets or desktops, the content needs to adjust to the size of he screen it is being displayed on. This is where responsive sites come in. Adding in extra code to the site so that no matter the size of the screen the site is always going to be understandable and well presented.
      <br>This is important because there is such a wide variety of devices to use the internet on and all are becoming more popular and more used, so sites must keep up with change.

    <h2>What is a wireframe, and why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>
      A wireframe is like a plan of your website, drawn up on paper or using a graphics tool.
      This helps to code the site with less time wasted, as everything is already on paper and just needs coding.
    </p>

    <h2>Difficult Aspects of my Wireframe</h2>
    <p>

      I also had trouble aligning the title and image.
