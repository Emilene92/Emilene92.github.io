  <p>
    Before watching chapter two of Search Inside Yourself, I had never really thought about meditation so I don't have much of an opinion on it. 
    <br>After reading chapter two, I have learnt that meditation is great for mental wellnes as well as your health, an that happiness is a default and that there is no right or wrong way to meditate.
    <br>All of the video on meditation stood out to me and I am going to try and meditate everyday as I think it will be fantatstic for me and my focus, I have never meditated before so it will take a bit of getting used to!
