   <h2>Which timebox and habits technique did you try?</h2>
   <p>
     I havent tried any techniques this week, I do plan on trying some out from Monday.
   </p>
   <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
   <p>
     The idea of forming a habit and having the mindset come after is interesting but it does make a lot of sense.
   </p>
   <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
   <p>
     I havent tried any techniques this week, I do plan on trying some out from Monday, so will update then.
   </p>
   <h2>Which technique will you experiment with further?</h2>
   <p>
     I think I will try out the pomodoro technique as I think having set breaks will really be beneficial for me.
