  <h2>What's your take on DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
  <<p>
    I think the DBC/EDA experience is very engaging and focused. I think that it is great that it teaches programming, and empithy but also exposes us to new environments that we will be working in.
  </p>
  <h2>What is your impressions?</h2>
  <<p>
    My impression of EDA is I don't think that it will be easy, it seems to be a lot of work in a small amount of time but I do think it will be a great experience.
  </p>
  <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this culture?</h2>
  <<p>
    I think I will take a bit to warm up to this way of learning and working. I am use to working in a team in hospitality, but I do think this will be different.
  </p>
  <h2>Have your expectations changed?</h2>
  <<p>
    My expectations have not changed, I did quite a bit of research and reading of blogs before applying so I think my expectations were fairly correct.
  </p>
  <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
  <<p>
    I am very excited, extremely nervous because I think it will be very different to what I am use to, but I am looking forward to it.
