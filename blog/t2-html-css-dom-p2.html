  <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>  
  <p>
    Grid systems bring structure and balance to a website. As a tool grids are useful for organizing and presenting information. They can enhance the user experience by creating predictable patterns for users to follow.

  <h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
  <p>
    Responsive design uses a flexible grid. Depending on the screen resolution, blocks of content are positioned differently on the page. Content remains the same and should therefore be written concisely. This is good because people are more commonly using tablets or mobile phones so web pages need to be adjustable to fit all screen sizes.

  <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
  <p>
    So explaining semantic structure is going to be difficult for me, from what I understand it is all about the structure of the page and using the correct HTML tags in the correct places, ie. using h1, h2 etc in order of importance and not just to highlight words, using < p > tags for paragraphs and not to put spaces on the page.
    Semantic HTML, or "semantically-correct HTML", is HTML where the tags used to structure content are selected and applied appropriately to the meaning of the content.
