  <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    I thought the chapter was interesting, but I didn't take a lot from it. It is very interesting to read that emotional intelligence can be trained, and I will be doing some more reading and probably read that chapter a few more times.

  <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
  <p>
    The two minutes whent a lot faster than I thought it would, my mind did wander a bit, about what to write here, but I focused on my breathing. It was extremely relaxing.
