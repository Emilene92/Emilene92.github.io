  <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
  <p>
    So to describe HTML, CSS and Dom to a non-technical friend... HTML is the structure of the website, kind of like a house, it's the windows, doors, framework etc. You use HTML to build the website.
    CSS is like the designer, which color would you like the walls in the bedroom? You use CSS to make your web page look pretty, with colours fonts, and pretty buttons.
    Now DOM, so I'm still coming to grips with DOM, DOM is about the way you access and interact with the website. Not entirely sure how to describe it..

  <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
  <p>
  Boxifying a design makes it a lot easier to build your website, it is a simple way to figure out where everything will go on your website. Everything on your website must fit into a box as the website is made up of lots of BOXES.
  </p>
  <h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>
  <p>
    In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about the design and layout of your website. It is boxes that wrap around every HTML element, your margins, borders etc. Everything on your page is a box.
